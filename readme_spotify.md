#  Decoding the Hits: Analyzing the Spotify Top 50 (2019)

##  Business Problem

With fierce competition in the music industry, data-driven decisions are crucial. 
Resonance Studios challenged our team to uncover what musical traits define a global hit on Spotify.

**Hypotheses:**
- Songs with high danceability and energy are more likely to chart globally.
- Big-name artists are overrepresented in the top 50.
- Shorter songs (under 3.5 minutes) perform better on streaming platforms.

We used SQL aggregations and visual analysis to test and support these hypotheses.

##  Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle – Top 50 Spotify Songs 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leonardopena/top50spotify2019)
- **Records:** 50
- **Features:** Track name, artist, genre, energy, valence, BPM, popularity, and more.

---

##  Data Cleaning & Preparation

Performed in `spotify_proyect_clean_04.ipynb` using Python (pandas):

- Renamed columns to `snake_case`.
- Cleaned `track_name` of special characters using regex.
- Grouped sub-genres into broader categories for consistency.
- Dropped rows with missing `artist_id` or `genre_id` to protect relational integrity.
- Removed duplicates and stripped whitespace from text fields.

---

##  Database Structure

Implemented in MySQL using `project_spotify_tables.sql`.

**Tables:**
- `artists (artist_id, artist_name)`
- `genres (genre_id, genre_name)`
- `track (track_id, track_name, artist_id, genre_id, bpm, energy, valence, etc.)`

**ERD available in:** `docs/erd_diagram.png`

Relational integrity enforced via foreign key constraints.

##  Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)
- MySQL + Workbench
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git + GitHub
- Google Slides (presentation)

##  Exploratory Data Analysis & Visuals

EDA was conducted using scatterplots, bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps.

- Most tracks fell within high ranges of energy, valence, and danceability.
- Pop and Latin were dominant genres.
- Track durations centered around 3.2–3.5 minutes.

We produced over 4 high-quality visualizations that revealed key genre and feature correlations.

---

##  SQL Insights

SQL queries performed:
- JOINs between `track`, `artists`, and `genres`
- Aggregates by genre: AVG(valence), AVG(danceability)
- Filtered Top 10 tracks by tempo, valence, and popularity
- GROUP BY queries to analyze genre and artist distribution
- Subqueries to highlight standout combinations
